## relationship between an API and a software development kit (SDK)
An API is a set of insturtions and prosedures that allow a developer to create an application that can access infomation from 

The relationship between an API and a SDK would be that an API is useful for specific methods while SDK is useful for a lot more methods as well as contain more tools for developing. However, because an API is more specific with its methods it is more useful when dealing with a specific problem. Using the API will save a lot of space when developing while the SDK will still have the extra tools that it comes with so it will take up unnecessary space what would be better suited to other elements.

## The number of useful APIs
There are a number of useful APIs that can be used on a single platform that can have a range of uses one use of an API would be a random number generator which can be used to produce a random number between a range in a program. An example of a random number generator API being used within a program. Another API that ca be used would be Facebook's API. This API allows communication across a wide arrange of Facebook platforms.

## An application that can be extended using APIs
There are many applications that can be extended using a suitable API. One of these applications would be a webpage. The webpage will contain all it needs too but a API will allow the webpage to display an interactive map from google that the user will be able to use on the webpage. This is useful for a lot of webpages so it is the most common uses of API. Another application that can be extended using API is the application Discord which has their own API which can be used to create your own bots that can be used on the platform to manage different servers and small communities though a profanity filter or by responding to commands.

## The potential security issues with an API

## Application Design

## An exsisting application with a API implemented
An exisisting applciaiton that did not have a API implemeted into is was a applicaiton called traceball which is a small basic game that can be played on a web browser. Using the google maps API a map can be added to the game to show how a API can be implemented into any program.
